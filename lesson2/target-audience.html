        <p> This site is intended for people of all ages. Young people can start learning the effect of weather in their
            lives. Adults can make preparations for their daily schedules, or plan a vacation for the coming weeks.
            Anyone with access to an internet connection from any part of the world, will be able to use the site.</p>

        <p>1. Georgina, sixty-two years old, she checks the weather everyday because she likes to share with
            everyone the forecast. She tells her married sons and daughters how's the weather in different parts of the
            country and the city, and feels that she can help them be prepared in case a storm is coming. She finds it
            also useful to know if she can dry her clothes to the sun, or if she has to water the plants.
        </p>
        <p>2. Ignacio, thirty-four years old, is planning a vacation trip with his family next month. He has to make
            careful plans in order to have sunny days at the beach, because he has heard rumors that an hurricane will
            be arriving to the beach by that time. He has already requested some days off at his work, but he is on time
            to change the destination. He will find it very useful to have continuous weather information and alerts in
            case something unexpected happens. </p>
