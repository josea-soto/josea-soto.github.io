            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>

            <p>By simplifying the number of choices that a user faces in apple's website, they encourage decision
                making. We can see there is almost no other choice but scrolling to continue exploring iphone's
                features. Hick's law, or the Hickâ€“Hyman law, describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision
                as a result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time
                logarithmically. </p>

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h3>Codecademy</h3>
            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">https://www.codecademy.com/</a>
            <img src="images/Codecademy.PNG" alt="Jose A. Soto at the top of a building">
            <p>Menu options are located at the top of the page, which makes it simple for the user to reach them.
                Additionally, log-in or sign-up buttons and text boxes are grouped together, facilitating their
                selection one after the other. Grouping is important in communicating the functionality. Fitt's law
                states that selecting a UI element can be faster if the size is increased or the distance decreased.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3>Dribbble</h3>
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/">https://dribbble.com/</a>
            <img src="images/Dribble.PNG" alt="Jose A. Soto at the top of a building">
            <p>Dribble's landing page shows an image which is approximately one-third of the total horizontal space and
                two-thirds of the total vertical space. The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as
                sectionided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical
                lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their
                intersections. Proponents of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more
                tension, energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject. </p>
